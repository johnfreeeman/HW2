		After all the experience until now, I can proudly say I have done diverse
		jobs in many different fields. With the leadership experience I <br> learnt in army,
		I could easily lead my two thousands trainees or <br>coworkers to move forward in a corporate. <br>
		I learnt a lot of responsibility and possibility. <br>
		As a CEO of food truck, I realized the value of production, business and finance. This skill triggers me more into business.
